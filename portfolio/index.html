            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I've always been interested in web development, mainly because I'm big into programming in general.
                I feel like it's a useful skill to have, at the very least to diversify my programming skills to not focus on just one type.

            <h3>3 Things Good to Learn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript: Order is important.</li>
                <li>Javascript: How objects/classes work compared to Java.</li>
                <li>CSS: How its syntax works.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where to go from here</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From here, I feel like diving a lot more into Javascript would be my best path. There's projects I have in mind
                that may require some Javascript knowledge.
